## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.fangjinuo.langx</groupId>
    <artifiedId>langx-java</artifiedId>
    <version>${langx.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
